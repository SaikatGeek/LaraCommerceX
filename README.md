A Laravel based e-commerce application. 

Some features are:
-> Login, Sign Up & Reset Password system.
-> Add the product details and show the product list on the table
-> Admin can delete & edit the product. Here I used a soft delete option. So if you deleted some product for the first time then you can restore the deleted product. You also can permanently delete the product.
-> Add the category & have a choice to selected category option on the navigation bar.
-> Sign Up not required before the checkout. 
-> Use the IP ADDRESS to find the unique customer who has already selected the product to the cart.
-> Admin views the customer messages and views message have a different color.
-> Category based product showing option.
-> Related product is suggested.
